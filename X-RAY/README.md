To use this the way it was intended, export the epk file of any world from the original version of eagler. Next, import it into X eagler. Enter the map and all stone textures have been changed to glass. This makes all ores and structures visible underground. You may mine as much ores as you want. When you are done using X eagler, export the x-ray version of the map you just used and import it as a new world on the original eagler version.
